# AdaFsihCount—Dataset
Aquaculture encompasses a variety of farming practices, such as cage culture and recirculating aquaculture systems. Across different farming modes—or even within the same mode under varying conditions—there exhibit substantial domain gaps arising from changes in water conditions, fish behavior, and camera viewpoints. These domain discrepancies can critically undermine the practical deployment performance of vision-based fish counting methods. To address this, we constructed an optical dataset comprising data from four cage farms and two RAS ponds to support the development of fish counting methods that can adapt to multiple target domains. Further validation was conducted using a publicly available dataset exhibiting variations in lighting conditions.
